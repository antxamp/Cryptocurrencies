# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview:
So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The data I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the team lead is looking for, they have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, the lead has decided on a clustering algorithm. The lead will use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.

### Resources: 
  - Jupyter Lab (MLENV kernel), Python3.7, Pandas, hvplot 
  - Resource files and module 18 starter code supplied
  
### Objective:
#### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
#### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
#### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
#### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


## Results from all Deliverables:
